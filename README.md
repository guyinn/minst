Functions to Create MINST from Fonts, Combine MINST Data Files, Generate PNG from MINST etc. Written it in PHP

I was playing around with the MINST and wanted to see if machine can identify the digit images generated by publicly available .ttf fonts
Didn't find utils to manipulate or generate MINST data, so wrote few, may save someone's 5-6 hrs of work. Feel free to add/change and share.

There are three main functions available as public static in MINST class.
